NAME
    Test::Moose::More - More tools for testing Moose packages

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::Moose::More;

        is_class 'Some::Class';
        is_role  'Some::Role';
        has_method_ok 'Some::Class', 'foo';

        # ... etc

DESCRIPTION
    This package contains a number of additional tests that can be employed
    against Moose classes/roles. It is intended to coexist with Test::Moose,
    though it does not (currently) require it.

TEST_FUNCTIONS
  has_method_ok $thing, @methods
    Queries $thing's metaclass to see if $thing has the methods named in
    @methods.

  is_role $thing
    Passes if $thing's metaclass isa Moose::Meta::Role.

  is_class $thing
    Passes if $thing's metaclass isa Moose::Meta::Class.

SEE ALSO
