NAME
    Test::Moose::More - More tools for testing Moose packages

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::Moose::More;

        is_class 'Some::Class';
        is_role  'Some::Role';
        has_method_ok 'Some::Class', 'foo';

        # ... etc

DESCRIPTION
    This package contains a number of additional tests that can be employed
    against Moose classes/roles. It is intended to coexist with Test::Moose,
    though it does not (currently) require it.

TESTS
  has_method_ok $thing, @methods
    Queries $thing's metaclass to see if $thing has the methods named in
    @methods.

  is_role $thing
    Passes if $thing's metaclass isa Moose::Meta::Role.

  is_class $thing
    Passes if $thing's metaclass isa Moose::Meta::Class.

  check_sugar_removed_ok $thing
    Ensures that all the standard Moose sugar is no longer directly callable
    on a given package.

  check_sugar_ok $thing
    Checks and makes sure a class/etc can still do all the standard Moose
    sugar.

  validate_class
    validate_class {

        attributes => [ ... ],
        methods    => [ ... ],
        isa        => [ ... ],
        does       => [ ... ],

        requires_methods => [ ... ],

        meta => {
            class => {
                ...as above
            },
            attribute ... etc
        },
    };

  validate_role
    The same as validate_class(), but for roles.

  validate_thing
    The same as validate_class() and validate_role(), except without the
    class or role validation.

FUNCTIONS
  known_sugar
    Returns a list of all the known standard Moose sugar (has, extends,
    etc).
